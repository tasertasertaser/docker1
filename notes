If using Sublimetext, consider installing Dockerfile Syntax Highlighting

To pick up where you left off : docker-machine ls (checks that Char exists)
                              : docker-machine restart Char (restarts the Char machine)
                              : re-run eval$(docker-machine env Char) to set up environment variables

------
PART 1
------

01 : use --driver to use the virtualbox driver
02 :
03 : eval() evaluates the command before executing (why do we have to do this?)
04 : 
05 : despite saying it "runs a command" inside a new container, the run command actually launches a new container (whereas "start" does not). "launch" is not a command.
06 : visit http://<ip of Char>:5000 in browser to verify it works
   : -d runs container in background
   : -p publishes container's ports to host
12 : -e sets an environment variable (here, MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD) 
   : --restart=always means the container can restart on its own
14 : --link <container-name> allows this container to use that as a database
   : don't forget -p!
19 : Why does this container's name come out hashed?
   : install Flask with pip install Flask (if in background, use docker exec Abathur [...])
   : I really tried to echo this bullshit into the file without Vimming it open but line 3 wasn't having it
20 : use --advertise-addr to specify the address advertised to other members of the swarm, for API access & networking
22 : unclear why these are all joined to port 2377 but everyone did that so I did too
   : docker node ls lists all nodes in swarm; wish it said "worker" for workers but it's just blank
23 : -d [arg] to set the driver to manage the network; here, overlay
27 : Not sure how to isolate to only 1 task
   : also, do we want the -f flag for live update?
30 : In what way are the task logs fun?
34 : -y option passes the "yes" without having to be asked

------
PART 2
------

00 : Why do you need to create the image and launch the container separately? Why can't you launch the container with a command in the actual Dockerfile? That seems like it would be better in every way.
   : Be sure to run with -i to keep stdin open -- otherwise Vim starts but is broken
   : Still unsure why -t is necessary
01 : https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/how-to-make-a-teamspeak-3-server/
   : Use the Linux one, not the mac one... ewps
   : Testing process for this is annoying - requires download of teamspeak client & some configuring
02 : This is going to be stupid
   : https://blog.codeship.com/running-rails-development-environment-docker/
   : http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#rails-dbconsoles
   : https://bundler.io/v2.0/bundle_install.html
   : https://dev.to/neshaz/how-to-use-rake-db-commands-in-the-correct-way--50o2
   : sure was stupid
   : >> fix: debconf: delaying package configuration, since apt-utils is not installed
